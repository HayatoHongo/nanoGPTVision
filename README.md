⚠️ **Status: actively being cleaned up and documented.**
The core ideas and training runs are real and reproducible,  
but parts of the codebase and README are still under active refinement.

`nanoGPTVision` is a **minimal Vision-Language Model built end-to-end**,  
featuring a **GPT-style text decoder trained fully from scratch**.

The project is heavily inspired by **Andrej Karpathy’s nanoGPT** and follows the same philosophy:
> understand the system by building it yourself.

A pretrained **CLIP vision encoder** is used for visual representations (Sorry😉),  
while **all language modeling and vision–language training code is written, data is public, and trained from scratch**.


---

## Why this project exists

Most open VLMs reuse large pretrained language models (LLaMA, Vicuna, etc.).

**nanoGPTVision does not.**

Instead, it focuses on:
- training the **text decoder from scratch**
- keeping the architecture minimal and readable
- making the design choices explicit
- showing how far you can go on a small, transparent budget

Alghough the CLIP encoder is external, to the best of our knowledge, 
this is the first publicly released publicly to build vision language model from scratch,
LLM and vision projector.

## Project philosophy

This is **not a polished product**.

This is a **work-in-progress research and learning project**.
